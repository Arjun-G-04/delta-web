## Normal Mode
### Status: Completed on May 15th 2023
* ~Display a grid of dimensions at least 20 x 20~
* ~The size of the snake is three tiles long~
* ~The Snake travels across the map to eat color blocks. The color blocks must be eaten in the correct sequence as displayed.~
* ~Implement a suitable scoring system~

* ~Make the game mobile responsive~
* ~Implement onscreen direction control to steer the snake~

## Hacker Mode
### Status: Yet to begin

* ~On completing a sequence of blocks, the snake grows in size~
* ~If the snake eats itself, the game ends~
* ~As time progresses, make the snake move faster~
* ~Implement power-ups that spawn randomly and gain buffs on eating them, such as shrinking the snake and slowing it down~
* Implement a pause button
* ~Implement sound on snake-eating word~
* Implement variable grid size as per player request
* Replace color blocks with letters and words to be eaten in the correct sequence
